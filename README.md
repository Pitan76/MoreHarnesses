# More Harnesses Mod

A mod that adds new harness items for the **Happy Ghast**.
By default, the Happy Ghast moves rather slowly. This mod introduces harnesses that can **increase its speed and defense**, making it more useful for travel or combat.


## Features

- **New Harness Items**:
    - Copper Harness
    - Iron Harness
    - Gold Harness
    - Diamond Harness
    - Emerald Harness
    - Netherite Harness
- Each harness provides **speed** and **armor** bonuses to the Happy Ghast.
- Stats for each harness are **fully configurable** via  
  `game_directory/config/moreharnesses.json`.
